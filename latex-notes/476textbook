\subsection{option pricing formula}
we know at expiry T, $V_T=payoff(S_T)$, we know $S_0$, what is $V_0$

solution: focus on relationship between S and V and time t, i.e. V(S,t), today's fair value becomes $V(S_0,0)$

this course we look at stock price in one year

stock: a share in ownership of a company

Divident: payment to shareholders from the profit

\section{The Black Scholes Equation}
This is basic PDE(parital differial equation) used in option pricing 

derivative security \begin{itemize}
    \item options
    \item futrues 
    \item forward contracts
\end{itemize}

\subsection{definition}

\begin{itemize}
    \item call option: Buy an asset at prescribed price K 
    (the exercise or strike price) This is a call option 
    \item put option: Sell an asset at prescribed price K 
    (the exercise or strike price) This is a put option 
\end{itemize}

suppose in the future, the price of the asset is S at time T 

Payoff = max(S-K, 0) for a call 

Payoff = max(K-S, 0) for a put

The holder has a right but not an obligation 

This contrasts with forward contract, where holder must buy or sell at a prescribed price

\subsection{A simple example the two state tree}
value of a stock is currently 20, it could be 22/18 in 3 months.

we value a call option to buy it in 3 months for 21.

We set up an imaginary portfolio consisting of the option and the stock 

the return earned by the portfolio must be risk free 

consider a portfolio consting of a long(positive) position 
of $\delta$ shares of stock, and short (negative) one call option.

We compute $\delta$ so that the portfolio is riskless. 

the value of portfolio is stock goes up is $\$22\delta -1$

the value of portfolio is stock goes down is $\$18\delta -0$

if we choose $\delta$ = 0.25, the value of the portfolio is 4.5 
no matter if stock goes up or down 

a risk free portfolio must earn the risk free rate.
suppose current risk free rate is 12\%, value of portfolio today must be the 
then the value of portfolio today must be the resent value of 4.5 or 

$$4.5*e^{-.12*.25}=4.367$$

value of stock today is 20, value of option is V,
then the value of portfolio is 
$$20*.25-V = 4.367$$

\subsection{a hedging strategy}

we well the option for .633, borrows 4.367 from bank,

we buy the .25 share at \$20,  in 3 months 
\begin{itemize}
    \item stock goes up to \$22, we pay option holder \$1, which leaves us with 4.5 
    \item stock goes down to 18, the call is worthless, the value of stock is 4.5
\end{itemize}


We see \emph{theoretical price of option} is cost for seller to 
set up portfolio, which pay the option holder and any bank loans at expirty of option.

\subsection{genral definition of financial deriustive contract}
A financial option/derivative is a financial contract at time t=0,
The value of the contract at future expiry T is determined by the market price of 
underlying asset at T

$S_t$ is underling price at time t, it is a stochoastic process.

Knowing the future value of contract in relation to the underlying price allows it to be used as an insurance

Holder bought insurance, how much should holder pay today

Writer bought risk (uncertainty) how much should the writer recieve

premium $V_0$

\subsection{payoff function}

$V_T=payoff(S_T)$

\begin{defn}[European option]
call option: right to buy at a preset price K at time T
put option: right to sell at a preset price L at time T
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}[American option]
The right can be exerciesed any time from now to exprity T
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[holder]
    buyer of the option, enters a long position, +
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Writer]
    seller of the option, enters a short position, -

    eg. -100 share means sell 100 share of balabala
\end{defn}

let V(S(t),t) or $V_t$ denote the option value at time t.
recall S(t) is price of item at time t

question: is the first argument a function or a value

when know at T, $payoff(S_T)$

question: what is fair value $V_0$ of the option today 

What are payoff functions $V_T=payoff(S_T)=max(S_T-K, 0)$

there can be many payoff functions 


\subsection{one perioad binomial, fair value of option, arbitrage, put-call parity}

consider an 1-perioad binomial case 
Auume: T=1 and up probablity is p=0.1
20->22/18

consider a call with K=21

then option value today is 
$$.1*1+.9*0=.1$$

side 

cash account continously compounds at risk free rate 

borrowing moeny from a bank is selling a bond 

depositing money to bank == buying a bond 

let a bond has value $\beta(t)$ at time t,
$$\frac{d\beta(t)}{\beta(t)}=rdt$$

solving this ODE by integrating both sides,
$$log(\beta(T))-log(\beta(t))=r(T-t)$$

Discounting: 1 year ago, 
$$\beta(T)=1 \rightarrow \beta(t)=e^{-r(T-t)}$$

Discounting: 1 year ago, 
$$\beta(t)=1 \rightarrow \beta(T)=e^{r(T-t)}$$

An aaritage is trading opportunity to make a no-risk
profit greater than that of a bank deposit 
which earns interest $r \geq 0$ 

Example: buy one share of stock and borrow 100 (sell bonds)
$$H_0=1*S_0-100\text{ or } H_0=\{S_0, -100\}$$
the value at time t:
$$H_t=S_t-100e^{rt}$$

Mathematical characterization of an Arbitrage Strategy 

A profolio with initail $H_0=0$ but $H^T>0$ is arbitrage

question: interest rate?

\subsubsection{Put and Call Parity} 

Assume stock $S_t$ does not pay divident, interest rate $r\geq 0$,
no arbitrage. Then at any time $t\in(0,T)$ European call $C_t$ 
and put $P_t$, with same stike K and expiry T, on the same underlying,
satisfies 
$$C_t = P_t + S_t - Ke^{-r(T-t)}$$

$$C_t - P_t = S_T - K$$ 
and put them all back in time $T\rightarrow t$

\subsection{1-period in binomial model}
\begin{itemize}
    \item option replication and heging 
    \item computing option fair value 
    \item risk neutrual valuation
\end{itemize}

hedge the uncertainty

\subsubsection{Pricing by Replication}

qustion what is $V_t$
Assume:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $S_t>0$
    \item no arbitrage 
    \item length of time interval $\delta t>0$
\end{itemize}
stock: $S_t$ $S^u_{t+1}=uS_t$ $S^d_{t+1}=dS_t$ 

bond: $e^{-rt}\rightarrow 1$

option: $V_t$ $V^u_{t+1}=uV_t$ $V^d_{t+1}=dV_t$ 


At t, construct portfolio$\{\delta_tS_t, n_t\beta_t\}$ so that:

Buy $\eta$ bond and $\delta_t$ stock

$$\eta_t+uS_t\delta_t=V^n_{t+1}$$
$$\eta_t+dS_t\delta_t=V^d_{t+1}$$
n is bond, $\delta_t$ is amount of stock

Note solution of $\eta, \delta$ is unique 

No arbitrage, then 
$$V_t=\delta_tS_t+\eta_te^{-rt}$$
 in other words 
 $$\{V_t, -\delta_tS_t\}$$ is risk free

I can construct combination of stock and bond st 
the value of the stock+value of bond equals value of option at time t+1

recall $S_T^u = 22 =1.1S_0$
$S_T^d = 18 =0.9S_0$

r=0 K=21

we get 
$$22\delta+1\eta=1$$
$$18\delta+1\eta=0$$

$\delta=\frac{C^u_T-C^d_T}{(u-d)S_0}~~~\eta=-4.5$ (sell bond borrow cash)

\subsubsection{risk neutral valuation}
note: no arbitrage assumge implies $d\leq e^{rt}\leq u$

consider 
$$\psi^u+\psi^d=e^{-rt}$$
$$uS_t\psi^u+dS_t\psi^d=S_t$$

the unique solution is $\psi^u=e^{-rt}q^*$, $\psi^d=e^{-rt}(1-q^*)$
$$q*=\frac{e^{rt}-d}{u-d}~~q^*\in(0,1)$$

we can then treat q as a probability

we get 
$$S_t=e^{-rt}(q^*uS_t+(1-q^*)dS_t)=e^{-rt}E^Q(S_{t+1})$$

Where $E^Q$ uses $q^*$ as probablity


Let $\{\delta_tS_t, \eta_t\beta_t\}$ be replicating portfolio

by writing $\beta_t$ as $(q^*\centerdot 1+(1-q^*)\centerdot 1)$



$$V_t=E^Q(V_{t+1})$$

risk neutral valuation:
$$\beta_t=e^{-rt}\beta_{t+1}$$
$$S_t=e^{-rt}E^Q(S_{t+1})$$
$$V_t=e^{-rt}E^Q(V_{t+1})$$

where $V_t$ is derivative on S.

for the example 

risk neutrual probability is 
$$q^*=\frac{e^{rt}-d}{u-d}=\frac{1-0.9}{1.1-0.9}$$
